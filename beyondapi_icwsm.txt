\begin{abstract}
The Internet serves as a vital platform for information access and global connectivity.
Widespread online engagement offers unprecedented opportunities to study human behavior at scale, yet researchers face significant ethical and technical barriers when attempting to collect data for academic studies.
In particular, major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have progressively restricted access to their official Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which previously served as primary tools for researchers to create customized datasets from specific platforms for studying online content production and engagement behavior.
This tutorial introduces the National Internet Observatory (NIO), an alternative data collection framework and infrastructure designed to help researchers study online behavior, with a particular focus on content viewing---the predominant form of online activity.
The tutorial presents NIO's informed data donation process, participant demographics and behavioral traces, and secure computing infrastructure.
The tutorial incorporates interactive activities and hands-on sessions that demonstrate NIO's capabilities for enabling novel cross-disciplinary and cross-platform research across web and social media environments.

\section{Introduction}

Individuals are increasingly spending a significant portion of their lives online.
Currently, more than half of the worldâ€™s population has access to the Internet,\footnote{\url{internetlivestats.com/internet-users}} with notably higher percentages in developed countries (e.g., 89\% of US adults, \citet{center2019internet}).
Dominant platforms like Google, Facebook, and YouTube are used by the majority of US adults,~\cite{smith2018social},\footnote{\url{statista.com/topics/1001/google}; \url{pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018}; \url{youtube.com/intl/en-GB/yt/about/press}} while several other platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, serve a smaller yet sizable portion of the population~\cite{smith2018social}.\footnote{\url{statista.com/topics/1882/instagram}}
%The Internet plays a pivotal role in connecting people and serves as a primary medium for obtaining and disseminating information.
The shift towards more extensive online engagement worldwide presents unique opportunities for researchers across various disciplines to study human behavior on an unprecedented scale.

%\footnote{\url{statista.com/topics/1001/google}; \url{pewinternet.org/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018}; \url{youtube.com/intl/en-GB/yt/about/press}} 

However, virtually none of this data is available for academic research.
The vast amount of data created about online human behavior is siloed, proprietary, with problematic scientific foundations, and often collected in ways that are on ethically shaky grounds.
%While useful studies have been conducted on the Internet and society in communication research, the current major instruments available for open science face severe limitations.
Many existing studies focus on X/Twitter, Reddit, and Wikipedia.
The collected datasets, however, are often not publicly available (e.g., X's terms of service forbid the sharing of tweets); are siloed; are rarely well documented and thus not replicable~\cite{gaffney2018caveat}; and are often decontextualized from other information about individuals.
The collection of such data has also become increasingly challenging and restricted in recent years, marking the transition into a ``Post-API'' era, with Facebook shutting down key APIs in 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal~\cite{freelon2018computational,bruns2021after}, and the effective closure of the Twitter/X API in early 2023---a data collection tool that has been at the heart of vast amounts of social media research~\cite{murtfeldt2024rip}.

Some researchers rely on data from vendors, including Nielsen, Comscore, and YouGov, who maintain panels of subjects and monitor their online activities.
Although such data provide unique insights, there are a number of problems associated with the vendors.
For example, Comscore and Nielsen are optimized for commercial clients, with pricing structures often incompatible with academic budgets.
These data collection systems are entirely proprietary, making it impossible to assess many dimensions of scientific validity, from sample to instrumentation quality.
Moreover, the ethical practices of these vendors are often non-transparent.

Other common limitations of the current instruments include (i) the focus on production behavior (content created and shared by users), as opposed to consumption behavior or exposure to content created by others; and (ii) an emphasis on a limited set of platforms, especially Twitter, which was often chosen due to the relative ease of data availability.
%In short, there is a pressing need for a scientifically rigorous infrastructure for academics to study behavior on the Internet. %comprehensively.

NIO aims to help address these challenges by serving as an open, large-scale, secure, and privacy-preserving observatory of online behavior to enable academic research without relying on bespoke data collection, proprietary sources, or partnerships with industry~\cite{feal2024introduction}.
Participants of NIO install a browser extension and/or mobile apps to donate their online activity data along with comprehensive survey responses.
The infrastructure offers approved researchers access to a suite of structured, parsed content data for selected domains to enable analyses and understanding of Internet use in the US.
This is all conducted within a robust research ethics framework, emphasizing ongoing informed consent and multiple layers, technical and legal, of interventions to protect the values at stake in data collection, data access, and research~\cite{meyer_enhancing_2023}.

This tutorial aims to provide a brief overview of the NIO infrastructure, the data collected, the participants, and the researcher intake process.
Further, the organizers will present concrete examples of research being conducted with this new source of data, in order to motivate and inform tutorial participants' own ideas around the kind of research they can conduct with NIO.
This tutorial will be interactive, as the organizers will gather participant requests for specific data analyses both before the conference and at the start of the tutorial; the organizers will then present some of those analyses towards the end of the tutorial in order to highlight analytic and research possibilities with NIO, grounded in participants' own aspirations.
There will also be a facilitated hands-on session where participants will themselves interact with and explore an aggregated, de-identified dataset built using NIO, such as browsing trajectories, data on time spent on various web domains, demographics of users visiting a variety of websites, etc.
An open-ended discussion with participants will enable feedback for future data products NIO can provide to the research community.

\section{Type of tutorial: free-style}

% The type of tutorial you are proposing: lecture-style, hands-on, translation, case study, or free-style.

%\pgnote{I am still confused between `Lecture-style' and `Free-style' (see descriptions under CfP -- Tutorials at icwsm.org/2025/submit/index.html); `Free-style' may need more assurances on interactivity and `practical skills'. Open to either, need to think which will improve our chances of acceptance and fits better. }

\section{Duration}

% A short timeline description of how you plan to break down the material over the proposed duration (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours). Please mention here the proposed duration, but keep in mind that the Tutorial Chairs might conditionally accept a proposal and suggest a different duration to best fit the organization of the whole event.

The proposed duration of this tutorial is 3 hours.
This tutorial is intended to be one continuous half-day session.

\section{Tutorial schedule and activities}

% A description of the proposed tutorial format, a schedule of the proposed activities (e.g., presentations, interactive sessions) along with a *detailed* description for each of them.

\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table*}

Our tutorial consists of different sections, including presentations and interactive activities (see Table~\ref{tab:schedule} for details).

In preparation for the tutorial, we will create a website that includes an overview about NIO, explaining the data collected, and help participants decide what kind of aggregated analyses they would like to see.

Our tutorial contains multiple interactive activities.
In the months before the conference, we will leverage the curiosity and expertise of the NIO and ICWSM
%WebSci
communities by soliciting ideas via social media and our website for data analyses that the community would like to see presented at the ICWSM
%WebSci
tutorial.
Using these proposed ideas as an example, we will demonstrate how NIO's review process works and how such analyses would be performed on NIO's computing resources.
We will similarly invite such requests during the tutorial, and aim to deliver some of the requested analyses towards the end of the tutorial.

We will also provide and facilitate access to an aggregated, de-identified dataset built using NIO, which participants will explore by themselves on their machines to understand at least one concrete example of the kind of data NIO can produce.
This could include rich data on web domains, such as visits per various demographic groups, time spent on domains, and a variety of potential independent variables from survey response data that can be studied for their association with domain-visit activity.

We will conduct an open-ended session at the end for general Q\&As as well as feedback for future datasets from NIO---the tutorial participants will get a chance to actively shape the future of this new research data source.

%\pgnote{Potentially something to add throughout is: promise to release at least one aggregated dataset publicly (can give examples of what that would look like), and an interactive activity will be playing with that data guided by maybe our own jupyter notebook to guide that data's exploration?}

\section{Target audience, prerequisites, and outcomes}

% A description of the target audience, the prerequisite skill set for the attendee (if any) as well as a brief list of goals for the tutors to accomplish by the end of the tutorial.

The tutorial is designed for academic researchers from all disciplines represented at the ICWSM
%WebSci
conference.
There are no formal prerequisites for participation.
We encourage anyone interested in online activity data collection and research to join.
While a background in digital behavioral research helps participants better understand the challenges and opportunities that NIO presents, it is not required to learn about this new data collection infrastructure.

By the end of the tutorial, participants will:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Learn about various methods of online activity data collection along with their pros and cons.
    \item Learn about a new infrastructure and framework for data collection in the post-API age.
    \item Learn about the research and analytical possibilities enabled by NIO and data donations, including the cross-platform potential of working with participants browsing activity, the kinds of research enabled by trace data being linked with survey data, and the interdisciplinary uses of these alternative data collection methods.
    \item Understand the data collected by NIO and how it could inform their own ongoing or future research.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Materials}

% The organizers of accepted tutorials will be required to set up a web page containing all the information for the tutorial attendees before the tutorial day (roughly 2 weeks before the tutorial day).
% The proposal should contain the list of materials that will be made available on the website.

%As stated above, in addition to all the specific contents of the tutorial, our website will provide an overview of NIO's infrastructure and data collection, and include a form for prospective participants to submit requests for aggregated data analyses that they would like to see presented at the tutorial.
Overall, the tutorial website will include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tutorial abstract.
    \item Broad overview of NIO's vision for enabling academic research using online web activity.
    \item Overview of all various types of data collected by NIO.
    \item Participant sample summary: sample size and sizes of various demographic groups.
    \item Detailed NIO ethics framework, per \citet{meyer_enhancing_2023}.
    \item Form for submitting open-ended comments and questions around the challenges and opportunities of working with NIO data, and more generally, working with alternative data collection frameworks like NIO.
    \item Form for submitting requests for aggregated data analyses that the organizers should present at the tutorial.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Past precedent}

% A list of other tutorials held previously at related conferences, if any, together with a brief statement on how the proposed tutorial relates to previous events. If the authors of the proposal have organized other tutorials in the past, pointers to the relevant material (e.g., slides, videos, web pages, code) should be provided.

This exact tutorial has not been offered before.
However, NIO was introduced in a previous tutorial at the International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2) 2024 conference, as part of and an example of new approaches to digital behavioral data collection in the post-API age. The tutorial was titled ``New Approaches and Data Sources to Study Digital Media and Democracy'' (website: \url{digidem-ic2s2.github.io/2024}).

The proposed tutorial offers an in-depth guide to data collection and research enabled by NIO and how US-based participants can apply for access to start working with NIO data.
Moreover, the tutorial covers the processes and various components involved in alternative, privacy-preserving modes of data collection that do not depend on platforms.% and respect the privacy of participants.
