    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The Internet serves as a vital platform for information access and global connectivity.
        Widespread online engagement offers unprecedented opportunities to study human behavior at scale, yet researchers face significant ethical and technical barriers when attempting to collect data for academic studies.</p>

        <p>In particular, major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have progressively restricted access to their official Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which previously served as primary tools for researchers to create customized datasets from specific platforms for studying online content production and engagement behavior.</p>

        <p>This tutorial introduces the <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org" target="_blank">National Internet Observatory (NIO)</a>, an alternative data collection framework and infrastructure designed to help researchers study online behavior, with a particular focus on content viewing—the predominant form of online activity.
        The tutorial presents NIO's informed data donation process, participant demographics and behavioral traces, and secure computing infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The tutorial incorporates interactive activities and hands-on sessions that demonstrate NIO's capabilities for enabling novel cross-disciplinary and cross-platform research across web and social media environments.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>There are no formal prerequisites for participation. We encourage anyone interested in online activity data collection and research to join. While a background in digital behavioral research helps participants better understand the challenges and opportunities that NIO presents, it is not required to learn about this new data collection infrastructure.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="details">
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>The tutorial is 3 hours (180 minutes) long, designed as one continuous half-day session.</p>
